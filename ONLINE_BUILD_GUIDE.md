## 🌐 Build Your APK Online - Step by Step

### Option A: AppGyver / Capacitor Cloud Build (Recommended)

#### Steps:
1. **Sign Up:** Go to https://ionic.io/appflow
2. **Create Free Account** (No credit card required)
3. **Create New App:**
   - Click "New App"
   - Name: "Attendance App"
   - Choose "Connect manually"
4. **Upload Your Code:**
   - Install Ionic CLI: `npm install -g @ionic/cli`
   - Login: `ionic login`
   - Link app: `ionic link`
   - Push code: `ionic git remote`
   
5. **Build:**
   - Go to Appflow dashboard
   - Click "Build" → "Android"
